# Baby-Wake-up-Observant-Buzzer
I have created a baby wake-up observant buzzer using python and OpenCV. I have also imported a python win sound module that will play a buzzer if the observant buzzer  detects quick motions of a baby means the baby has woken up. The mothers working in the kitchen or another room can be notified.It uses the webcam of your pc and and the playing buzzer can only be stopped if key-'q ' is pressed.
